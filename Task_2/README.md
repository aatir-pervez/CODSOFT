Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This project implements an AI agent that plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using the Minimax algorithm.

Features
	•	Human vs AI gameplay
	•	Unbeatable AI using Minimax
	•	Recursive decision-making
	•	Win and draw detection
	•	Terminal-based interactive game

Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Minimax Algorithm
	•	Recursion

How It Works
	1.	The game board is represented as a list of 9 positions.
	2.	The human plays as “X” and the AI plays as “O”.
	3.	The Minimax algorithm evaluates all possible future game states.
	4.	The AI selects the optimal move by maximizing its score and minimizing the opponent’s score.
	5.	The game continues until a win or draw condition is reached.
